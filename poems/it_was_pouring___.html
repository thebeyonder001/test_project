It was pouring
The drops suddenly disappeared
I wasn't numb, neither the weather
Drops returned in a bit though

I had an emptiness in me
In those few moments, i was complete
You pressing onto my left side
Isn't that where my heart is
    
You looked up, 
You don't say much but your eyes
Why didn't I looked right into them earlier
They gave me all the permission i needed

I leaned downward
And my lips embraced yours
This sweetness, i felt it for the first time
But surprisingly i had wished for it since ever

I was stagnant there, you too
Yet the time dilated?
Or did it brush past quickly
I had lost it probably, the sense of time

You were back into my embrace
The weather was cold,
I remember you were shivering a few minutes ago
Yet wasn't it so warm suddenly

Didn't i feel like a shelter to you?
And for me, you its inhabitant
The shelter had been waiting for some light
You just lit the fireplace and it was all alive now

I couldn't wait anymore
"Fuck it", i lifted your chin up
And time stopped again
The taste i stole, intoxicating

I wasn't restless
Neither were you, 
as if we had all the time in world
Would I ever feel this soothing again

This was here to stay
Closing my eyes, takes me back again
To that day, that place, the raindrops
The cold, the warmth, the juxtaposition

Oh, how much I wish
If You were just a bit more closer to me
Wasn't everything just perfect
Everything where it's supposed to be 
Everything how we wanted it to be
You just how you were meant to be 
All I want to say, 
Is, never leave; just stay
