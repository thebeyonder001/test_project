            <p>
                Hey there,<br><br>
                
                The day was tough but with the right set of people one is able to get through it. 
                I was clueless, lost; not knowing where to head to. Like... I had no control over where my mind was wandering to.<br>
                Last night, I asked mom to massage my head and it turned out to be the end of my peace. 
                A few minutes into it, the hair gathering up on my tshirt started worrying me. 
                This worry continued to increase until I couldn't take it anymore and asked mom to stop.
                 I got up, with an inner voice taking a resolution to not let her massage again but deep down I knew it wasn't her or anyone's fault.<br>
                 I sat down, thought maybe writing in the journal could help. I started writing. I had tears in my eyes. 
                 Mom looking intently at me as if I'd say something and I did; I told her what is my mental health like with this serious hairfall. It's eating away my confidence.<br>
                I stayed up late to read about what could possibly be done; supplements, diet, medicine, oils and what not. 
                Some looked promising, some had enough side effects to make me wait to consult a doctor. I still felt no motivation of going to sleep and then I suddenly realised that maybe talking to someone with this same condition could help me. I guess I didn't need medical help, as much as I needed mental support.
                 Sure, things may slow down, but the change is bound to be and what better than being prepared for it.<br>
                Finally, I went to sleep with the resolve to talk to someone next day; deciding not to worry.<br>
                I guess, this incident was a part of my personality development. My girl, tried to talk to me, but the kind of stuff I was thinking about just made me inaccessible to her help. She was persistent, calming me down, suggesting me home remedies and giving me true support. I still wasn't ready to listen.<br>
                But then she said something that changed my thinking in an instant. She told me that she understands that she can't really understand what it feels to be in that situation but she promised that she'll be there unconditionally for me, forever. She said "I'd not even think about my hair, just shave them off. Because I don't care how I look because I have you and my family who'll still love me unconditionally". 
                This touched me. This is the same girl who claimed that she isn't good at consoling people. <br>
                When she kept pressing me time & again about what exactly is it that I'm worrying about, I tried to answer but all I could answer was "I'd look hideous, funny", "people would laugh"; which seems quite logical. 
                But she understands me well enough to touch the exact trigger point of mine and how to push me. 
                She urged me to work, forget this all and let these people know who I really am; someone more than just some hair. 
                "Whatever happens, you'll stay the hardworking,.loving , awesome person that you are" ; I wasn't really in the state to accept that these words were meant for me. 
                But this girl has some serious skills to love the hell out of me and bring heavens to me. <br>
                How weird is this society, we didn't notice when did it become a normal thing to mock people for their appearance without having any clue what the person might be going through. 
                I talked to a friend of mine who has been in my situation, years earlier. 
                And he kept things dead honest with me that it does hurt your confidence, makes you feel incompetent, unable to approach anyone but you ought to realise that we are more than just some hair or abs or biceps or dimples. <br>
                It's painful to see the times we've come to let alone live in it. One person is stressing over being unable to gain weight and the other is starving to gain some outside validation. 
                And this validation is from the people who don't even care about us , who won't even matter in few weeks or even days. 
                But the comments of these people gives deep wounds, often making the person to mark the body with external wounds. 
                I honestly lost my point of writing today because there's so much to write and so difficult to pen it all down.
                 I remember a song "Victoria's Secret" by Jax. And it's quite good. Makes sense. 
                 Until it comes to us, we don't realise the sharpness of our words and the things people go through with these wounds that we cause.<br>
                I just wish that if not the whole world or hundreds of people, we all get that one person to talk about our pains. 
                It might not produce some solution magically, but everyone deserves a space to vent out without the worry of being judged or made fun of. 
                I understand reality doesn't run by my expectations but i guess we could start somewhere. 
                You give support to someone, they'd take stand for someone; I just believe that good will come back one day. 
                I might sound over optimistic here but hope is a nice thing to have; sometimes it's the difference between null and something.<br><br>
