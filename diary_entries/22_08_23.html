            Hey there,<br><br>
            
            The day was tough but with the right set of people one is able to get through it. I was clueless, lost ; now knowing where to head to . Like I had no control over where my mind wandered to.<br>
            Last night, I just felt like asking mom to massage my head and well It turned out to be the end of my peace. A few minutes into it, the hair gathering up on my tshirt worried me. This worry continued to increase until I couldn't take it anymore and asked mom to stop. I got up, with an inner voice taking a resolution to not let her massage again but deep down I knew it wasn't her or anyone's fault.<br>
             I sat down, thought maybe journal could help. I started writing. I had tears in my eyes. mom looking intently at me as if I'd speak something and I did; I told her what's my mental health is like with this hairfall. It's eating away at my confidence.<br>
            I stayed up late to read about what could I do; supplements, diet, medicine, oils and what not. Some looked promising, some had enough side effects to make me wait till we consult a doctor. I still felt no signs of going back to sleep and then I felt maybe someone with this same condition could guide me. I didn't help medically, I wanted mental support. Sure, things may slow down, but the change is bound to be and what better than being prepared for it.<br>
            Finally, I went to sleep. Deciding not to worry.<br>
            I guess, this incident was a part of my personality development. My girl, tried to talk to me, but the kind of stuff I was thinking about just made me inaccessible to her help. She was persistent, calming me down, suggesting me home remedies and true support. I still wasn't ready to listen.<br>
            But then she said something that changed my thinking in an instant. She told me that she understands that she can't really understand what it feels to be in that situation but she promised that she'll be there unconditionally for me, forever. She said "I'd not even think about my hair, just shave them off. Because I don't care how I look because I have you and my family who'll still love me unconditionally". This touched me. This is the same girl who claimed that she isn't good at consoling people. <br>
            When she kept pressing me time & again about what exactly is it that I'm worrying about, I tried to answer but all I could answer was "I'd look hideous, funny", "people would laugh"; which are quite logical. But she understands me well enough to touch the exact trigger point of mine and how to push me. She urged me to work, forget this all and let these people know who I really am; someone more than just some hair. "Whatever happens, you'll stay the hardworking,.loving , awesome person that you are" ; I wasn't really in the state to accept that these words were meant for me. But this girl has some serious skills to love the hell out of me and bring heavens to me. <br>
            How weird is this society, we didn't notice when it became a normal thing to mock people for their appearance without having any clue what the person might be going through. I talked to my friend who experienced my situation, years earlier. And he kept things honest with me that it does hurt your confidence, makes you feel incompetent, unable to approach anyone but you ought to realise that we are more than just some hair or abs or biceps or dimples. <br>
            It's painful to see the times we've come to let alone live in it. One person is stressing over unable to gain weight and the other is starving to gain some outside validation. And this validation is from the people who don't even care about us , who won't even matter in few weeks or even days. But the remarks of these people wounds deep, often making the person mark the body with external wounds. 
            I honestly lost my point of writing today because there's so much to write and so difficult to pen it all down. I remember a song "Victoria's Secret" by Jax. And it's quite good. Makes sense. Until it comes to us, we don't realise the sharpness of our words and the things people go through with these wounds we cause.<br>
            I just wish that if not the whole world or hundreds of people, we all get that one person to talk about our pains. It might not produce some solution magically, but everyone deserves a space to let out without the worry of being judged or made fun of. I understand reality doesn't run meet my expectations but i guess we could start somewhere. You give support to someone, they'd take stand for someone; I just believe that good will come back one day. I might sound over optimistic here but hope is a nice thing to have; sometimes it's the difference between null and something.<br>
